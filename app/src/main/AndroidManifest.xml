### Explanation of Key Components:
- **MainActivity**: Acts as the initial screen where users interact with the Facebook group finder tool. Upon launching, this activity guides users through the initial setup and preferences for their group search.

- **AutomationService**: In the background, this service automates the searching and management of Facebook groups based on user settings. It enables 24/7 operations, allowing users to find groups without needing to keep the app open.

### Permissions:
- **INTERNET**: Essential for making network requests to access Facebook’s data and group listings.
- **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE & READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: These permissions allow the app to store user preferences and any retrieved data, which enhances user experience by saving search history.

This configuration ensures the Facebook group finder tool operates efficiently, respecting user privacy and adhering to Android platform guidelines.
